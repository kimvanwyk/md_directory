  <p>
    The Email and Address fields are to allow a different email address and/or postal address to be specified for the particular club office. So for example, a member may receive mail related to the secretary's position at the club's PO Box. If that address is used here, the club's address will be listed for the secretary when they appear in the directory. This will override the address set for the member themself. Their own address will still be used for other positions they hold, such as a DC for example.
  <p>
    Similar, if the treasurer uses an email address specific to club treasurer related items, that address can be set here and it will be printed in the directory in the appropriate place for the club treasurer, instead of the members email address as set for the member themselves. Their own email address will still be used for other positions they may hold, such as a DC, unless it is overriden there too.
